A GUI tool designed to create a folder with the day's date and move a certain filetype into the folder

At my current job a certain filetype was being used to perform the export and import of 3D scans into a program. 
Unfornately there was no way of pulling the 3D scan into the program without losing the performed actions to the scan without keeping the expoted file, which was usually deleted at the end of the day.
I decided to create a tool that saves the files into a folder with the day's date, and it can be used at the end of the day with all of the files in a certain folder.
This ensures easy tracking of the files and keeps them organized in a simple way.
